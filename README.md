# Titanic_MachineLearning_from_Disaster    
This is a project for [Titanic dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) to predict whether the passengers survive.
The following notebook is my processes. The result of Project 1.0 is better than that of Project 1.0.  

1.  [Project 1.0](https://github.com/louispoweichen/Titanic_MachineLearning_from_Disaster/blob/master/Titanic_XGBoost.ipynb)
  
2.  [Project 2.0](https://github.com/louispoweichen/Titanic_MachineLearning_from_Disaster/blob/master/Titanic_XGBoost_2.ipynb)
